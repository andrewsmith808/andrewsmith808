Hi my name is Andrew. I am a recent graduate of University of California, Riverside with a B.S degree in Physics and I am an aspiring game programmer and software engineer.

My main interest lies in creating tools and technology for artistic expression. I aspire to develop simple, intuitive, clean, yet powerful interactive applications or underlying technologies that help people create their stories.

I'm currently learning computer graphics fundamentals and sharpening my programming fundamentals as well.

I am aslo looking for work!
