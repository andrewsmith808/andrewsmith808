Hi my name is Andrew. I am a recent graduate of University of California, Riverside with a B.S degree in Physics and I am an aspiring software engineer.

My main interest lies in creating tools and technology for artistic expression as well as developing reliable, tested, and quality software for infrastructure needs. I aspire to develop simple, intuitive, clean, yet powerful interactive applications or underlying technologies that imporove the experience and quality of a person's work.

I'm currently learning computer graphics fundamentals and sharpening my programming skills in C++, Python, and C#. I always love to learn new things and enjoy deep dives into a variety of topics.
